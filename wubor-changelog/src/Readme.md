# Introduction

Originating as a direct balance patch and later evolving into a larger project, The WuBor Patch is a modification for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate that aims to change the game in fun and interesting ways. While keeping Smash Ultimate at its core, The WuBor Patch is a unique experience with original system mechanics and overhauled characters.

This changelog is built off of the `main` branch of The WuBor Patch - this means that it will be up-to-date with any officially released version of the WuBor Patch.

This changelog is also ***HEAVILY UNDER CONSTRUCTION***. Everything is subject to change while formatting and changelog content is being figured out.
