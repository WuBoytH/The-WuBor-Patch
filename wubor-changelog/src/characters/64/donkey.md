# Donkey Kong

*We were buffing the first member of the DK crew anyway, so we decided to finally give him the good old DK Barrel. And it’s… pretty powerful. Heck, even giving DK a *nerfed* form of the barrel item was a massive buff. But we nerfed his weight and didn’t compensate, and his recovery and disadvantage are still garbage, so… Just learn the counterplay.*
