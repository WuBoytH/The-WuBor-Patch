# Joker
*Joker's pretty rad as is, but we wanted to rework the character and make him like the Persona 5 Arena that never was. I think. Maybe.*

#### Side Special (No Arsene) > Phantom Dash

<ovhl>
Joker now dashes forwards with a slash, launching his foes upwards.<br>
If the attack hits an opponent's shield, he stops in place.<br>
On the ground, holding Special duing startup has him take longer to dash, but this version of Phantom Dash is fully intangible and has little to no endlag.<br>
Ending Phantom Dash in the air puts him into special fall. Landing after frame 33 has him take 20 frames of landing lag.
Can grab ledge.
