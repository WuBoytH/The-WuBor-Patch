## Air Dash

Directional Air Dodging is now Air Dashing. They have no intangibility, are cancellable into attacks on frame 15, and are fully actionable on frame 30. Vertical Air Dash distance is significantly less than horizontal Air Dash distance. Landing with an Air Dash has 7 frames of Landing Lag.

Air Dashes are grouped into “tiers”, with each tier affecting Air Dash distance. A character's Air Dash Tier is listed alongside their changelist.

## Hyper Hop and Super Jump

Flicking the stick down and jumping from the ground will perform a special jump, which changes depending on if you Short Hop or Full Hop.
* Short Hop turns into Hyper Hop, which grants significantly more horizontal speed and movement.
* Full Hop turns into Super Jump, which increases your jump height at the cost of horizontal movement.
Both Hyper Hops and Super Jumps cut your horizontal control in half.

## Dash Cancels

Certain attacks in the game can be canceled directly into Dash. When canceling into Dash:
* Your Dash-to-Run frame is moved back by a few frames (the exact number varies by character's individual Dash-to-Run frame).
* Your character is completely inactionable until the Dash-to-Run frame.
